# Learn Reactjs
A JavaScript library for building user interface

## Background
- Built in JavaScript. Nobody knows what that is.
- [ES2015 or ES6](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features)
- Modular: a software design technique that emphasizes separating the functionality of a program into independent, interchangeable modules [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming)
- [Declarative](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/129628/what-is-declarative-programming)
- It's not a "framework", as the library is only used to create the User Interface, or the View layer (for web or mobile applications)

## Key points
- Reactjs is a JavaScript library
- Uses [JSX](http://buildwithreact.com/tutorial/jsx)

## Environment
- install node, npm (and yarn)
- Install [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app#getting-started) for convenience
  - This will allow us to skip over some details of learning Babel and other tools that are used to make Reactjs work

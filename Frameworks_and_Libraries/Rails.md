# Learn Ruby on Rails

It's a web development framework built in Ruby.

## Key points
- [Model - View - Controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller)
- Build full-stack web apps fast
- Don't Repeat Yourself: "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system."
- Convention Over Configuration: "Rails has opinions about the best way to do many things in a web application, and defaults to this set of conventions"

(read just enough to understand the general concept)
- Embedded Ruby (ERB templates) - write Ruby in the view files, creates a number of conveniences

# Learn Reactjs
A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Main Docs: [reactjs.org/docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)

## Background
- Built in JavaScript. Nobody knows what that is.
- [ES2015 or ES6](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features)
- Modular: a software design technique that emphasizes separating the functionality of a program into independent, interchangeable modules [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming)
- [Declarative](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/129628/what-is-declarative-programming)
- It's not a "framework", as the library is only used to create the User Interface, or the View layer (for web or mobile applications)

## Environment
- install [`node`](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [`yarn`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yarn)
- install [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) so we can skip over React's build configuration

## Key points
- Reactjs is a JavaScript library
- Uses [JSX](http://buildwithreact.com/tutorial/jsx) (JavaScript syntax extension)
- Introductory [tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) building a tic-tac-toe game
- Codeacademy [course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/react-101)

## Debugging
- Install [React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en) into your Chrome browser

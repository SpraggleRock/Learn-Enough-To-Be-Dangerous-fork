# Git

## Assessment
1. Why would I create a new branch?
* What do I do if I commit some private credentials?
* What happens if I type ‘git branch -D make-it-happen’ into the command line?

## Exercise 1: PR workflow
1. `git clone` this repo
* `git checkout` a new branch
* Make a change to a bunch of files
* `git add` just this file
* `git status`
* `git add .`
* `git status`
* `git commit` just this file with a nonsensical `-m 'message'`
* `git commit .` the rest of the files with a very serious `-m 'message'`

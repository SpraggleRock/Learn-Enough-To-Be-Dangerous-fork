[Database](https://www.codecademy.com/article/wix-what-is-a-database) - the definition.

[Quick SQL Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sql)- Learn to communicate with databases using SQL, the standard data management language.

## Types of Databases
The two most common types of databases are:
- relational - often tabular which suits itself to identifying and accessing data in relation to another piece of data
- non-relational - commonly referred to as NoSql, stores unstructured data and typically scales better

### Relational Databases
A [relational database](https://www.codecademy.com/article/what-is-rdbms-sql) typically stores data in tables made of rows. A relational database management system RDBMS) is a program that allows you to administer a relational database and typically uses SQL to access the database. 

Popular relational database management systems include:
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Oracle DB](https://www.oracle.com/database/)
- [SQL Server (Microsoft)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-2017)
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) 

### Non-Relational Databases
A non-relational or NoSQL database has a flexible schema and can take a variety of forms. A key-value store is the simplest type where all of the data is in a single table and contains a unique key and a value. A document database stores the data in some form of document like JSON or XML and particular elements can be indexed for faster querying. A column-based or column-oriented database is one where the data becomes the main key rather than an id. A graph databases focuses on the relationship between data elements where each element is stored as a node and connected to other nodes via links.

Popular non-relational databases include:
- [Redis](https://redis.io/) - a key-value store
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - uses a document data model
- [Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/) - column-based database
- [Neo4J](https://neo4j.com/) - a graph database
